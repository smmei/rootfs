DirectFB Tutorials
------------------

This package holds documented code examples that teach you the basics
of DirectFB programming and should help you to get accustomed to the
DirectFB API. The docs/html directory has a HTML-formatted tutorial.


If you want to build the code examples or rebuild the HTML pages, you
need to have DirectFB and pkg-config installed. DirectFB is available
from http://www.directfb.org/. If you don't already have pkg-config
installed get it from http://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/.
Once all requirements are successfully installed, you simply need to
type

 ./configure
 make

The file INSTALL has more generic instruction on how to use the
configure script and make.


You should then find the HTML documentation in the directory docs/html.
The examples are built in subdirectories of the src directory:

 simple    - Simple initialization and drawing example for a
             full-screen application.

 image     - Image loading and displaying.

 text      - Drawing text.

 sprite    - Moving a sprite with the cursor keys.

 keybuffer - Key-buffer and simple alpha-channel example.
