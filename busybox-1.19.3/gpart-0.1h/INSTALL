   gpart Compilation and Installation


   Up to now a configure script for gpart does not seem necessary,
   it should compile under Linux and FreeBSD using GNU cc and GNU
   make.

   Steps to compile and install:

    - change the installation directory prefix "prefix" in the
      file "inst.defs". The default is "/usr/local".

    - type "make".
    - if no errors were encountered, type "make install".

   It is a good idea to read the man page before starting to
   play around.
